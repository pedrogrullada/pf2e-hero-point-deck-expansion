# PF2e Hero Point Deck Unofficial Expansion
A simple compendium module containing a journal with several unofficial cards<sup>1</sup> to expand upon the original Hero Point Deck, as well as rollable tables incorporating these new cards with it, and tweaks for some of its cards.

## What is the Hero Point Deck?
It is a [deck of cards sold by Paizo](https://paizo.com/products/btq024ut) to use in conjunction with Hero Points. Each card has a trigger and an effect that you must spend a Hero Point to use, and when you do, you discard both the card and the Hero Point. In that sense, you can think of the card as representing your Hero Point. You can still spend Hero Points for their normal reroll and death-prevention uses.
## What does the expansion contain?
- A journal with a growing library of homebrew cards, written in a similar style to the original Hero Point Deck.
- A journal with "patches" for existing cards where I have felt their power level is lacking for the cost of a Hero Point.
- A compendium of Foundry effects automating the cards' effects whenever possible.
- Rollable tables to draw a random card, whether you want to use this module's cards exclusively, or add them to the original Hero Point Deck, as well as a rollable table with the module's patches for original cards.
## How to use this module?
Once you have enabled the module, you will see a compendium folder named "Hero Point Deck Expansion" containing three compendia. If you want to browse the cards, go to the journals compendium to see the expansion and patched cards. Once you're ready to start drawing random cards, go to the module's tables compendium and drag the table you want to your macro bar!

While rollable tables are sufficient to draw random cards, I highly recommend you make use of the [PF2e Toolbelt](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/pf2e-toolbelt) module's [Hero Actions](https://github.com/reonZ/pf2e-toolbelt/wiki/Hero-Actions) feature. The module will allow your players to use, discard, and even trade cards amongst each other, all from their own character sheets! All you need to do is go to PF2e Toolbelt's settings and link the appropriate table to draw cards from.
